# Fractal Code Quantum Alpha v3.0 - InfinityBit Logical Compression Mode

Fractal Code Quantum Alpha v3.0 represents a disruptive breakthrough in the field of extreme data compression.  
Based on logical InfinityBits (Ibits), this engine predicts minimum redundancy paths, entangles redundant fragments, and implodes storage structures through multilevel fractal collapse.  
Achieving compression down to 9.94% of the original file size, while ensuring 100% bit-perfect recovery.
